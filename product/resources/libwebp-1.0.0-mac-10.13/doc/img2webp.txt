NAME
       img2webp - create animated WebP file from a sequence of input images.

SYNOPSIS
       img2webp [file_level_options] [files] [per_frame_options...]
       img2webp argument_file_name

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents the img2webp command.

       img2webp  compresses  a sequence of images using the animated WebP for-
       mat.  Input images can either be PNG, JPEG, TIFF or WebP.  If a  single
       file  name  (not  starting  with  the character '-') is supplied as the
       argument, the command line argument are actually  tokenized  from  this
       file.   This  allows  for easy scripting or using large number of argu-
       ments.

FILE-LEVEL OPTIONS
       The file-level options are applied at the beginning of the  compression
       process, before the input frames are read.

       -o string
              Specify the name of the output WebP file.

       -min_size
              Encode  images to achieve smallest size. This disables key frame
              insertion and picks the parameters resulting in smallest  output
              for each frame. It uses lossless compression by default, but can
              be combined with -q, -m, -lossy or -mixed options.

       -kmin int

       -kmax int
              Specify the minimum and maximum distance between consecutive key
              frames (independently decodable frames) in the output animation.
              The tool will insert some key frames into the  output  animation
              as needed so that this criteria is satisfied.
              -mixed Mixed compression mode: optimize compression of the image
              by picking either lossy or lossless compression for  each  frame
              heuristically.  This  global  option  disables  the local option
              -lossy and -lossless .

       -loop int
              Specifies the number of times the animation should  loop.  Using
              '0' means 'loop indefinitely'.

       -v     Be more verbose.

       -h, -help
              A short usage summary.

       -version
              Print the version numbers of the relevant libraries used.


PER-FRAME OPTIONS
       The per-frame options are applied for the images following as arguments
       in the command line. They can be modified any number of times preceding
       each particular input image.

       -d int Specify the image duration in milliseconds.

       -lossless, -lossy
              Compress  the  next image(s) using lossless or lossy compression
              mode. The default mode is lossless.

       -q float
              Specify the compression factor between 0 and 100. The default is
              75.

       -m int Specify  the  compression method to use. This parameter controls
              the trade off between encoding speed  and  the  compressed  file
              size  and  quality.   Possible values range from 0 to 6. Default
              value is 4.


EXAMPLE
       img2webp -loop 2 in0.png -lossy in1.jpg -d 80 in2.tiff -o out.webp
